3. Update: Modify user details and click "Save changes"
4. Live Refresh: The user card updates immediately with the new data

## Installation & Setup

4. No build process or npm installation required!

## Key Functions

- `loadData()`: Fetches users from the API

- `modalConstruction()`: Attaches edit functionality to buttons and contructs modal functionality
- `updateCard()`: Updates the UI after successful PUT HTTP method sent to API
- `formFactory()`: Dynamically generates the edit form
